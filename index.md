### Download Sites

Puppy Linux variants since version 2 are hosted at [Ibiblio](http://distro.ibiblio.org/puppylinux/).

Ibiblio also hosts the puppy specific packages (pet) used to build puppies as 
well as squashfs files (sfs) with kernels, kernel sources, large applications 
and application frameworks.

The Ibiblio puppylinux directory is mirrored by several sites world-wide.

The [NLUUG](https://ftp.nluug.nl/ftp/pub/os/Linux/distr/puppylinux/) and the 
[UoC](http://ftp.cc.uoc.gr/mirrors/linux/puppylinux/) mirrors in Europe and 
the [AARNET](http://mirror.aarnet.edu.au/pub/puppylinux/) and the 
[Internode](http://mirror.internode.on.net/pub/puppylinux/) mirrors in 
Australia are known to update regularly and are usually faster than Ibiblio.

_Mirrors may take up to a day to incorporate changes in Ibiblio_.
