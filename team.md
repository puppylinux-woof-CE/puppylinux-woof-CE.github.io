## Puppy Linux Team

Puppy Linux team is you! Yes, you. No, this is not a joke. 

If you are a member of the Puppy Linux community, then you are a member 
of the Puppy Linux Team. Membership is automatic. What you choose to
do as a member is the Team is up to you. You can choose to just use
Puppy Linux and do nothing else. That is fine. You can also 
choose to contribute back to Puppy Linux. That is also fine, but it is
not a requirement.

Puppy Linux Team works on [do-ocracy](https://communitywiki.org/en/DoOcracy)
principle. Something will be done if any of the team members feel the 
itch to do that something.

### Contributing back

There are many ways to contribute back what you receive from Puppy Linux.

1. If you are good at writing, help to write some documentation about
   Puppy Linux. Or help keeping this website current.
   
2. If you are good at arts, you can always contribute artworks 
   (background pictures, icons, icon themes, colour themes, audio
   themes).
   
3. If you're good at video publishing, help to create some sort of videos
   about Puppy Linux (marketing, inspirational, educational, etc) and
   upload it to common video sharing websites such as You Tube.

4. If you have some extra space in your server hosting, help
   to mirror Puppy Linux files.
   
5. If you're good at troubleshooting, stand by in the forums and support
   people who ask for help.
   
6. If you're good at coding, help to improve various programs used in
   Puppy Linux.
   
7. And so it goes. Whatever talent you have, there is 
   always something that you can do to improve Puppy Linux and its
   community. 
   
Yes, you are always invited. And you are always welcome.



### Organisation Structure

There isn't any.
