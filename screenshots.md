## Screenshots

### Official Puppies

Traditionally, Puppy Linux has used the combination of 
[JWM](http://joewing.net/projects/jwm/) and Rox Filer Desktop. It persists
until this day. Love it or hate it, you can't argue with the lightness on the 
system of this combination. It has certainly stood the test of time!

There has been a couple of exceptions to this rule, notably when Lupu's
developer Larry Short decided to try _IceWM / Rox_ combination but ultimately
settled on _Open Box / FBPanel / Rox_.
